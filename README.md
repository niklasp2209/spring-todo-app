# TODO List Application

This is a small project that demonstrates a simple TODO list application. It consists of a **frontend** for displaying and interacting with the TODO list and a **backend** to manage the TODO items via RESTful APIs.

## Purpose

This project is created as part of a technical assessment for a job application. It showcases the use of modern web technologies, such as:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend
- **Spring Boot** for the backend
- REST API integration between frontend and backend

The backend stores all TODO entries in memory during runtime, and the frontend communicates with the backend using JavaScript's `fetch` API.

## Features

- **Frontend**:
  - Display all TODO items
  - Delete a TODO item by clicking on it
- **Backend**:
  - Provide REST endpoints for managing TODO entries
  - In-memory storage for simplicity

## Notes
- This project is intended solely for recruitment purposes and not for production use.
